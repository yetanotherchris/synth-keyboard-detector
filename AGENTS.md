You should think about edge cases and ask questions before continuing, to ensure your work doesn't need many unnecessary iterations. Ask clarifying questions, as many as needed.

Provide an initial summary of the work you are about to do, the tasks you believe you need to carry out. Before continuing ask if this needs any adjustments and if your plan looks correct.

You should always delete any temporary files including test scripts you have generated after finishing your work.

When you have finished, provide a one paragraph summary, no emojis or bullet points.
