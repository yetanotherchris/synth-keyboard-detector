1. You should now use the width of white key that was detected in stage 8, as the width of all white keys.
2. Find each key's position, from left to right across the image.
3. Using 8 different colours, starting with the green, highlight each white key.
4. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the image width.
5. As before, do this process for both the smallest white-key only image, and the image of the keyboard.
6. Rename each image to match its step number so we can refer to this in future. Make sure stage 1 crop 50% is actually stage 2. The final stage should now be stage 7: : Green Solid Overlay

Stage 1 is "original image". Stage 2 is "crop bottom 50% of image". Use primary colours and secondary colours as the colours for keys, with green being the first colour.
