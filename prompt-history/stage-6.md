1. The previous detection assumption was incorrect - the piano white keys have some lines between each key so the output to draw colours onto them is incorrect.
2. Instead, please use the same detection method that is used for the first white key, to calculate the x coordinate and width of each white key.
3. Write these to a JSON file.
4. Using these X coordinates and widths, draw the colours onto each key.
