Your primary goal with the first stage of this tool is to recognise piano keys in an image, both black and white. The goal is know each key's area, or rectangular coordinates. The white keys all have the same rectangle size as do the black keys. They will be predictable in their arrangement.

Use the temp directory for all temporary images and test scripts, they should be put in this directory and run from this directory.

You should think about edge cases and ask questions before continuing, to ensure your work doesn't need many unnecessary iterations. Ask clarifying questions, as many as needed.

Provide an initial summary of the work you are about to do, the tasks you believe you need to carry out. Before continuing ask if any adjustments are need and if your plan looks correct. Wait for a response.

You should always delete any temporary files including test scripts you have generated after finishing your work.

When you have finished, provide a one paragraph summary, no emojis or bullet points.
